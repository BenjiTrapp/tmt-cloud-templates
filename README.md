# Benji's templates for m$ Threat Modeling Tool

Some tiny Templates containing Stencils and Threats with some tiny examples for the Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool 2016 (download it [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49168)). The magic behind it can be found in the [Threat Modeling Manifesto](https://www.threatmodelingmanifesto.org/) and hopefully soon on my github page as well.
